# Alpha 2 (0.0.0r2)
Added support to the following maps when loading images to the game:
- _ControlMask
- _Normal
- _Emissive
- _MaskMap

Use these suffixes at the name file to make them loaded within the main image (the one without any suffix). Reference about maps behavior [can be found at game Wiki.](https://cs2.paradoxwikis.com/Asset_Creation_Guide#Meshes_and_Textures)

The image size limit was raised to 2048x2048.
