# IT'S BETA AND IT MAY BREAK YOUR GAME. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

This is the Cities Skylines 2 version of Write Everywhere ([CS1 mod version here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2887458944)). 
It keep some of the features from the CS1 version plus some new features that are only possible in CS2.

For detailed reference and samples, [look this repository](https://github.com/klyte45/CS2-WriteEverywhereFiles).

## Suggested usages

- Add texts in game from properties of any object of the game
- Add textured planes to simulate structures, like walls and signs
- Make color-animated planes with images (requires some coding)
- Add plates to the vehicles of the game with the style you wish.

This list isn't exhaustive and many more uses are already possible. Use your imagination!

## Requirements

This mod is simpler to understand when compared with its CS1 version, but it still being a mod with a lot of stuff that must be discovered by the users - specially at this moment.

More documentation will be added in the future.

## FAQ

First of all, read the [files repository](https://github.com/klyte45/CS2-WriteEverywhereFiles) to get the basic information.

- **How I can customize the vehicle plate letters and number?** 
  - It will be available in another mod. [Addresses mod will have a implementation](https://mods.paradoxplaza.com/mods/74182/Windows) in future versions, wait for news.
- **The vehicle plates are not appearing in my game!**
  -  It's probably because you either haven't added the plate locations folder inside your local layouts folder (as explained in the files repository above) or didn't imported a plate layout to your savegame. Notice that not all vehicles were mapped yet.
- **How can I find the properties of the objects to get the texts?**
  - If what you want is not in the builtin functions, so you will need to use modders tools like [Scene Explorer](https://mods.paradoxplaza.com/mods/74285/Windows) to inspect the objects you want to extract information from.
- **There's any Discord server I can ask for help with this mod?**
  - No, I have no specific Discord server for support. Leave your questions at Paradox forums and I will response as soon as I can.
  - You can ask for assistance in general Discord servers from CS2, may I be there but I can't promise I will be able to respond.
- **There are any videos showing how to use this mod?**
  - Not from me. Maybe fellow youtubers/streamers can learn stuff from this mod and make videos in the future (let me know if you do any to highlight here)

## Special thanks
I want to thank the people that helped me with CS2 modding since first days, specially mentioning **yenyang** and **krzychu**. Also thanks **Chameleon**, **Mimonsi** and **Nullpinter** for testing the mod during the development process.
